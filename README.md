## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
A basic CountDown App with Light and Dark Theme support. The time to countdown from can be set via 3 TextFields (hours, minutes, seconds) and during the countdown, a progress circle will visually indicate how much time is left.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I'd say the most interesting part is how the State enum is used to compose the UI. Seeing how easily you can actually map a State to UI
is definitely a major advantage of Compose over the existing UI Framework.
